Like most languages, R can directly perform calculations.

```{r}
40*32/8
```

You can create objects using *<-* (assignment operator). <- is the recommended assignment operator in R.

```{r}
my_variable <- 2
my_variable
```

In terms of variable names, R is the same as most languages where the variable name must start with a letter and can contain numbers and .'s. Generally the errors in most languages are quite informative for these mistakes.

The tab key can be used for auto-complete of statements.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

Pressing the keys alt + shift + k will display keyboard shortcuts
