Any files with a commit message beginning with "R for Data Science..." are summaries
I have made based on the book R for Data Science which has been made available 
online by the authors at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html.

Where possible I have attempted to rephrase the examples in simpler terms but such
is the quality of the book that I often repeat exactly what the authors say. Therefore
I would recommend anyone looking at this to read the book and only use these summaries to 
having working examples of the code.
