As previously mentioned the pipe operater *%>%* helps us to stop having to assign the results of each operation to a new variable.

The pipe operator is located in the *magrittr* package which is loaded by default in most of the main packages.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(nycflights13)

flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  count(carrier)
```

Instead of having to assign the result of the grouping to a new object we can use the pipe operator to continue with our analysis.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
